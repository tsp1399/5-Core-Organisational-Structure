# **Core Team Structure for Modern Accounting Firms**

### **1. Document Purpose**

- To provide a structured guide on implementing a **Core Team Structure** for modern accounting firms.
- Outline the purpose, philosophy, and functions of each team in a way that balances ethical values with operational excellence.
- Support firms in transitioning from traditional organizational models to an adaptable, AI-integrated structure that enhances client satisfaction, employee engagement, and long-term strategic growth.

---

### **2. Underlying Philosophy**

- **People-Centered and Ethical**: This structure is designed to prioritize the value and growth of individuals within the firm, recognizing that a supportive, ethically grounded environment leads to sustainable success.
- **AI-Enhanced Human Roles**: AI is not a replacement for human roles but a support tool that empowers professionals to focus on strategic, creative, and client-centric tasks.
- **Adaptability and Continuous Improvement**: The structure emphasizes flexibility and the ability to evolve with changing industry demands, technologies, and client expectations.
- **Client-Driven Value with Business Impact**: This model is rooted in delivering meaningful, high-impact services to clients while balancing efficiency and profitability through operational excellence.

#### The urgency of this transformation is supported by compelling industry data

- The accounting profession faces a critical talent pipeline crisis, with bachelor's degree completions dropping 7.8% in 2021-2022 alone, contributing to a concerning 16.9% decline in accounting graduates over the past decade.
- Current demographic trends show 75% of public accounting CPAs will retire within 15 years, while voluntary turnover rates average 15% in CPA firms.
- 69% of accounting/finance employees are planning job searches in the next 12 months, signaling widespread dissatisfaction with traditional structures.

These statistics underscore the need for a fundamental reimagining of how accounting firms operate, attract talent, and create value.

### **4. The Five Core Teams**

#### **4.1 Leadership & Strategy Layer**

- **Purpose**: To set the vision, uphold ethical standards, and align the firm’s strategies with long-term goals while balancing commercial viability.
- **Key Roles & Responsibilities**:

#### **Sarah's Story: A Day in Our Future**

*Sarah, a Senior Tax Accountant in our Operations & Quality Assurance Team, shares her experience:*

"When I first heard about AI integration, I was worried about becoming obsolete. Now, I can't imagine working any other way. My AI assistant handles routine calculations and compliance checks, giving me time to dive deep into complex client scenarios. Yesterday, I collaborated with our Client Strategy team on a challenging international tax structure - the kind of strategic work I never had time for before. The best part? I'm learning and growing every day."
